## Penetration Testing Labs

### [Lab 1: Samba Enumeration & Privilege Escalation](https://github.com/seerat-fatima21/Samba-Exp)
- **Objective:** Exploit a critical Samba vulnerability (CVE-2007-2447).
- **Key Steps:** Service enumeration with `enum4linux`, exploitation with `Metasploit`, post-exploitation activities, and password cracking.
- **Result:** Achieved remote code execution with root privileges.

### [Lab 2: SSH Access & Kernel Exploitation](https://github.com/seerat-fatima21/SSH-exp)
- **Objective:** Gain SSH access and perform local privilege escalation.
- **Key Steps:** SSH login with compromised credentials, kernel vulnerability (CVE-2009-1185) exploitation.
- **Result:** Successfully escalated privileges to root.

### [Lab 3: MySQL to Web Shell](https://github.com/seerat-fatima21/mysql-exp)
- **Objective:** Achieve remote code execution via a MySQL service.
- **Key Steps:** Brute-force with `Hydra`, hash cracking with `John the Ripper`, web shell upload.
- **Result:** Gained RCE and performed data exfiltration.

### [Lab 4: vsFTPd 2.3.4 Backdoor Exploitation](https://github.com/seerat-fatima21/ftp-exp)
- **Objective:** Exploit a backdoor in a vulnerable FTP service.
- **Key Steps:** Service discovery with `Nmap`, exploitation with `Metasploit`.
- **Result:** Obtained a reverse shell.

## Incident Response & Digital Forensics

### [Incident Response Journal: DFIR Case Studies](https://github.com/seerat-fatima21/DFIR-Case-Studies)
- **Objective:** Analyze and document security incidents using the 5 W's framework.
- **Cases:** Ransomware Attack, Malware Infection, Data Breach.
- **Key Skills:** Root cause analysis, containment strategies, mitigation recommendations.
